#VIDEO GAME POPULARITY PREDICTION

The video game market has only continued to grow over the years and is now spanning all genres. It has continued to grow and expand into a lot of different walks of life, from movies and TV-shows to even books/fan-fiction. With this growing market the various gaming publishers will want to capitalize on the interests of the various gamers within it and picking the right kind of game to develop and put out into the market could make or break a gaming publisher/studio.


This GROUP PROJECT is about how we can train a machine learning model to predict video game sales and its popularity.In this project we are using "LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL" to predict a certain video game popularity from the dataset we collected.
